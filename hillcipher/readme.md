# Hill Cipher - Python Implementation

## Overview

This is a Python implementation of the **Hill Cipher**, a classical encryption algorithm that uses matrix operations to encrypt and decrypt messages. The Hill Cipher encrypts and decrypts text using a square key matrix, and it works with blocks of text of the size corresponding to the matrix dimension.

## Features

- Encrypt and decrypt messages using a square key matrix.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase English alphabetic characters.
- Uses modular arithmetic to wrap text within the 26-letter alphabet.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `numpy`: For matrix operations and handling key matrices.

To install the required dependencies, use the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy
